# simple-chain-code
 A simple chain code algorithm to perform basic image processing.

 Given any input image, the code is able to find a set of different features for the object in the image:
 
 1. Get the initial point of the object, that is, the first point of the object, from left to right.
 2. Get border points of the object;
 3. Get number of points in the border of the object;
 4. Calculate the perimeter of the object, that is, its size;
 5. Build pixel map representing the object.

 Other auxiliary functions provide the height and width of the object.
